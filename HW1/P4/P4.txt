My graph is available in two versions: edges_rdd and graph.
edges_rdd contains all the connections between characters as tuples, without duplicates and links to self.
graph is a grouped version of this, containing a character as key and a list of characters as connections.

A diameter of 10 imlplies that all nodes can be reached within 10 steps from any node, since the longest 'shortest path'
is 10 steps (given all nodes are conected in one graph).

"CAPTAIN AMERICA": 6408 nodes visited
"MISS THING/MARY": 7 nodes visited
"ORWELL": 9 nodes visited

This means that the network consists of diconnected sub-networks.
