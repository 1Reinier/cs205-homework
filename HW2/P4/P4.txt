MULTITHREADING EXPERIMENT
-------------------------
1 Thread: 12 seconds
2 Threads: 9 seconds
4 Threads: 5 seconds
See P4.png for a visual.

The more threads we seem to add, on the basis of just these three points, we seem to experience diminishing returns
from adding threads. First, the gain is relatively big (1 to 2), and then we have smaller gains (2 to 4).
