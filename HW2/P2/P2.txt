DESCRIPTION THREE SCALES OF LOCKING
-----------------------------------
The three scales of locking: fine, medium, and none (serial), show very different execution times. In the native
implementation, the serial execution time is under 1 second, while fine-grained completes within 14 seconds, and
medium-grained within 19 seconds.
